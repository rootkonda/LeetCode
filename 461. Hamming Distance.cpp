/**
The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.
Note:
0 â‰¤ x, y < 231.

Two ways:

1. First XOR two numbers and then use bitset to find the count of 1's.
2. First XOR two numbers and then num%2==1 and num/=2 repeatition will give the count of 1's.
