/**

Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Return True if n is a happy number, and False if not.

Take any positive integer n and sum the squares of its digits. If you repeat this operation, eventually youâ€™ll either end at 1 or cycle between the eight values 4, 16, 37, 58, 89, 145, 42, and 20.
